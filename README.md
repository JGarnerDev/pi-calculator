# Project goals

The idea here is to make a Javascript program that will calculate the irrational number Pi to the nth digit, where n is the argument given.

From Wikipedia:

> \[Pi\] is defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and it also has various equivalent definitions.

As such, it becomes useful to see what definitions exist out there to measure the comparitive efficiency when using JavaScript for the purpose.

Furthermore, the idea is also to make this program accessible via HTML and CSS. The following are intended features in their order of priority:

- As a user,
  - I would like to enter a number to see that many digits of Pi
  - I would like to see Pi be generated infront of me as the program does its task
  - I would like to be able to clear and reset the process
  - I would like to be able to control the rate at which the program displays the digits of Pi
  - I would like a 'copy' button to make it easier to copy-and-paste the number elsewhere
